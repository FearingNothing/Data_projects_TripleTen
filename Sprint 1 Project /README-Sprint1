This first project for my BIA course was to advise potential investors on which property type to invest in for a Manhattan Airbnb.  The questions asked were as follows.

**Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?**

Hells Kitchen, Midtown and Harlem look to be the most popular sites, each generating well over $1.5 million in revenue.  For Hells Kitchen and Harlem, the 1 BR sites are top list.  In Midtown, the studio apartments are most popular.

**How much money did these listings generate?**
- Hells Kitchen - $1,899,336.00
- Midtown- $1,732,212.00
- Harlem- $1,640,470.00

**Do different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes?**

The data suggests that each neighborhood in the top listings tend to heavily favor the studio (0 bedroom) for Midtown and 1 bedroom for all other listings

**Using number_of_reviews_ltm as a criterion of attractiveness, build a pivot table to answer this question: Which 10 neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?**
- Lower East Side
- Hells Kitchen
- Harlem
- Midtown
- Upper West Side
- Chelsea
- East Village
- East Harlem
- West Village
- Upper East Side
