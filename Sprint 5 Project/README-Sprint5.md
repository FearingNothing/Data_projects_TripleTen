This project was to determine the root cause for excessive returns at the fictional "Superstore".  It entailed the full process of creating a Tableau dashbord and story to find these causes and suggest ways to lessen their frequency or effect.

The first 6 sheets of the workbook depict the requested graphs, as listed here;

1. A scatterplot showing the correlation between total sales and total returns. Aggregate by product subcategory. Do sales always correlate positively with returns?

2. A bar chart showing the return rate by product category

3. The return rate by customer. To find customers who are more prone to making returns, add a filter to remove customers with only 1 order.

4. A map showing the return rate by some geographic measure (state, city, etc.) to see if there is a geographic concentration to returned orders

5. The return rate by some measure of time (month, week, etc.) to see if there is a seasonal effect to returned orders

6. Two different kinds of composite charts showing the return rate for a mix of multiple factors (date/geography/product category/etc.) Here there are 2 charts and an accompanying dashboard combing the two.

After finalizing the dashboards, I was to create a story from the data, this is listed as Main Story in the workbook.  Each story point depicts the finding or function of the point and presented graphs.

The first story slide is my summary of findings which lists the root causes and my thought in response to the presented questions.

Each Data graph in the story features a text desription of its main function.

The Dashboard Interface story slide features all previous graphs and their filters in one interface.  Allowing for a deeper analysis of the data. 

The final slide of the story is my afteraction recommendations.
