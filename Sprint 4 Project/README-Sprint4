[Ray Woodruff Sprint 4 Project](https://public.tableau.com/views/RayWoodruffSprint4Project_v6/Part3-3?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The project focused on a sales dataset from the fictional "Superstore".  The objective was to dertemine where sales were being lost in an effort to increase profits.  For the project we were to assume the superstore was approaching bankruptcy.

These were my findings

**Part 1: Profits and Losses**

*1. Among the pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) which are the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers? Justify your conclusion with a visualization.*
>
>According to the data in the subcategory + region dimensions, the two biggest profit centers for the Superstore are Copiers and Phones. Whereas the two biggest loss centers are Bookcases and Tables.
>

*2.Which products should the superstore stop selling? Justify your conclusion with a visualization.*
>
>According to the data, the pair subcategory + SUM(Profit), The profit for the products within the Tables, Bookcases and Supplies are least among all subcategories.  Cutting these items would have the least impact on overall profit
>

*3.Which product subcategories should the store focus on and which should they stop selling? Choose 3 of each.*
>
>Again using the dimension pair subcategory + SUM(Profit),  Accecories, Coolers and Phones are the 3 highest profiting subcategories, and Tables, Bookcases and Supplies are the least profiting; in fact, these subcategories are causing a significant amount of loss for the store.

**Part 2: Advertising**

*Identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in. Make a visualization of the average profit for each month of the year for those 3 states and argue how much you would be willing to pay in advertising for those states in those months.*
>
>My research indicates that Washington, New York and California are the three more profitable states for the Superstore.  This is indicated in Part 2-1a of the analysis.  The three most profitable months for the Superstore, as indicated in Part 2-1b of the analysis, are September, November and December.  From this I would suggest a layered advertising scheme as follows.
	a)In September, concentrate on ads in Washington.
	b)In November, concentrate on ads in New York.
	c)In December, concentrate on ads in California.

**Part 3: Returned items**

**Use this new field (Returned) to create a visualization for each of the following questions:**

*1.Which products have the highest return rate? *
>
>The visualization shows the list of products with returns.
>

*2.Which customers have the highest return rate?*
>
><ol>
  <li>Seth Vernon</li>
  <li>Ted Butterfield</li>
  <li>Anthony Johnson</li>
  <li>William Brown</li>
  <li>Clay Ludtke</li>
</ol>
>

*3.Present a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.*
>
>Here the data charts were the response as they depict the trends leading to the lost profit.
